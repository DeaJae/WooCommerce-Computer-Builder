WooCommerce-Computer-Builder
============================

<h2>Description:</h2>
A modified version of Woocommerce Custom Product Builder which works with Cart instead of its own internal query. Hopefully this version will be more customizable, compatible and faster.

<h3>Quick Q&A's</h3>
Who's this for?<br>
Anyone who wants a product customizer what reads your current products and categories and presents them in said format.
Users choose what option they want and it gets added to the cart.

Is this just for PC/Computer equipment?<br>
No, It can be used for anything which you want customer to have a choice over. Kit cars, camera packs, Even groceries?.. Maybe an idea for another project.

This looks fairly mashed up?<br>
Well, I've only been coding for a few years in PHP and recently got into WordPress development, I found WCPB (https://github.com/philippjbauer/WoocommerceProductBuilder) previously on Github, tested it and found a few issues and flaws.
As this plugin is based off that plugin, I'm putting All credit to the Author. As its not been updated for a while I'm just getting it upto scratch!

Why did I get invovled?<br>
I saw potential, and wanted something like this to work on my site. Most of the work was done, just not upto date. Naturally I wanted to learn more code and get my first plugin done.

<h3>instructions</h3>
Create a main category containing your products.
Create the child categories to house the options.
Create the products and set them up.
Install plugin, and set up the base category, options.
And that should be it!
<h4>Current Issues and 'working ons'</h4>
-Testing SubCategories, some odd effects.<br>
-Adding Tags, helpful if you list socket types, useful prot info on these.<br>
-Improve mini-cart updating. Not working with AJAX at the moment.<br>
-Removing lots of useless code and tidying up files.<br>
